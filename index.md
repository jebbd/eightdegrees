The {eightdegrees} ðŸ“¦ offers two colour palettes for use with the
{ggplot2} package.

I was inspired by the colour palette of the limited edition, Munro
series from [Eight Degrees Brewing](https://www.eightdegrees.ie/), an
Irish brewery in Cork.

Both scale\_colour\_\* and scale\_fill\_\* functions are included.

The structure of this package is heavily inspired by the
[{colorblindr}](https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr) ðŸ“¦.

Degrees Brewery, I just liked the colours and the beers.</font>
