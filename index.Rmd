## Eight Degrees Brewing
[Eight Degrees Brewing](https://www.eightdegrees.ie/) are an Irish brewery in Cork. I was inspired by the colour palette of their limited edition, Munro series.  
    
Both scale_colour_* and scale_fill_* functions are included. The structure of this package is heavily inspired by the [{colorblindr}](https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr) `r emo::ji("package")`.

I am in no way affiliated with Eight Degrees Brewery, I just liked the colours and the beers.</font>
